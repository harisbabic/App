### **User Management Module Breakdown**

The User Management module is foundational to the application, handling user-related operations such as registration, login, profile management, and role assignment. Below is a detailed breakdown of this module, including its responsibilities, sub-modules, and directory structure.

#### **1. Responsibilities**

- **User Registration**: Handles the creation of new user accounts.
- **User Login**: Manages user authentication, including session management.
- **Profile Management**: Allows users to update their profiles, including personal information and preferences.
- **Role Assignment**: Associates users with specific roles (e.g., admin, user) and manages these roles within the system.
- **Password Management**: Manages password-related tasks such as resets and updates.

#### **2. Sub-Modules**

1. **User CRUD Operations**:
   - **Create User**: API endpoint for registering new users.
   - **Read User**: Fetch user details, typically by ID or username.
   - **Update User**: API for updating user details.
   - **Delete User**: Handle the deletion of user accounts (soft delete or permanent).

2. **Authentication**:
   - **Login**: Handle user login and JWT token generation.
   - **Logout**: Invalidate tokens or sessions to log out users.
   - **Session Management**: Manage active user sessions, including token validation and renewal.

3. **Password Management**:
   - **Password Reset**: Allow users to reset their passwords, typically through a token-based mechanism.
   - **Change Password**: Enable users to update their passwords while logged in.
   - **Password Encryption**: Use strong encryption algorithms (e.g., bcrypt) for storing passwords securely.

4. **Role Management**:
   - **Role Assignment**: Assign roles to users based on their function or access level.
   - **Role Validation**: Ensure that roles are correctly enforced throughout the application.

5. **Profile Management**:
   - **Profile Update**: Allow users to update their personal information and preferences.
   - **Profile Picture**: Manage user profile pictures, including upload and storage.
   - **Preferences Management**: Store and manage user-specific settings within their profiles.

#### **4. Key Components and Their Descriptions**

- **`user.controller.js`**: Manages all incoming HTTP requests related to user management, such as registration, updating profiles, and retrieving user data.

- **`auth.controller.js`**: Handles authentication-related endpoints, including login and logout operations.

- **`user.model.js`**: Defines the schema for the User entity, including fields like username, email, password, roles, etc.

- **`role.model.js`**: Defines the roles within the system, linking users to specific roles and permissions.

- **`user.service.js`**: Contains the business logic for user management, separating it from the controller to ensure a clean architecture.

- **`auth.service.js`**: Manages the core authentication logic, such as verifying credentials and generating JWT tokens.

- **`password-encryption.js`**: Utility for encrypting and validating passwords using a secure algorithm like bcrypt.

- **`auth.middleware.js`**: Middleware that checks if the incoming request is authenticated by verifying JWT tokens.

- **`role.middleware.js`**: Middleware that validates if the authenticated user has the correct role to access a specific resource.

#### **5. Testing and Validation**

- **Unit Tests**: Focus on testing individual components in isolation (e.g., user service, authentication service) to ensure they work as expected.

- **Integration Tests**: Ensure that the different services (e.g., user management and authentication) work together correctly.

- **End-to-End Tests**: Simulate real-world scenarios where a user might register, log in, update their profile, and log out, validating the entire workflow.

#### **6. Documentation**

- **`architecture.md`**: Provides an overview of the module's architecture, explaining the relationships between controllers, services, and models.

- **`api.md`**: Details the API endpoints, including request/response formats, authentication requirements, and example requests.

- **`setup.md`**: Instructions for setting up the user management module, including dependencies, environment variables, and configuration files.

#### **7. Deployment and Scaling**

- **Dockerfile**: Containerizes the user management module, allowing it to be deployed independently within a microservices architecture.

- **docker-compose.yml**: Facilitates local development by orchestrating the user management service along with its dependencies (e.g., database).

- **Scaling Considerations**: The module should be designed to handle scaling horizontally by adding more instances behind a load balancer. User-related data can be sharded across multiple databases if necessary.
