### **2.2 Audit Logs Module Breakdown**

The Audit Logs Module is essential for maintaining a secure and compliant application by providing detailed logs of user actions and monitoring critical events. This module supports traceability, accountability, and helps in detecting suspicious activities.

#### **1. Responsibilities**

- **User Action Logs**: Record all significant actions performed by users within the application, such as logins, data modifications, and access to sensitive information.
- **Critical Event Monitoring**: Capture and log critical system events, including security breaches, unauthorized access attempts, and changes to system configurations.
- **Compliance and Reporting**: Ensure that the logs meet regulatory compliance requirements and can be easily exported or reviewed for audits.

#### **2. Sub-Modules**

1. **User Action Logs**:
   - **Action Logging Service**: Centralized service that records user actions across the application.
   - **Log Storage**: Secure storage for log data, ensuring it is tamper-proof and accessible for auditing.
   - **Log Retrieval API**: API endpoints for retrieving and searching through user action logs.

2. **Critical Event Monitoring**:
   - **Event Monitoring Service**: Monitors and logs critical events within the application, such as failed login attempts or unauthorized access.
   - **Alerting System**: Generates alerts based on predefined rules when critical events occur.
   - **Event Log Storage**: Secure storage specifically for critical event logs, ensuring high availability and security.

3. **Compliance and Reporting**:
   - **Compliance Log Formatter**: Formats logs to meet specific compliance standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
   - **Reporting Tools**: Tools for generating audit reports based on the logged data, supporting both scheduled and on-demand reporting.

#### **4. Key Components and Their Descriptions**

- **`ActionLoggingService.js`**: Captures and records all significant user actions, ensuring they are stored securely and can be audited later.
- **`EventMonitoringService.js`**: Monitors the system for critical events and logs them for further analysis.
- **`AlertingSystem.js`**: Generates alerts when specific critical events occur, such as unauthorized access attempts.
- **`ComplianceLogFormatter.js`**: Formats logs according to compliance standards, making them ready for audits or regulatory checks.
- **`ReportingTool.js`**: Provides tools to generate comprehensive audit reports from the stored logs, helping in regular audits and compliance checks.

#### **5. Testing and Validation**

- **Unit Tests**: Ensure that each logging and monitoring service functions correctly, reliably capturing and storing data.
- **Integration Tests**: Validate the interaction between different components of the audit logs module, such as log retrieval and alerting systems.
- **Compliance Tests**: Check that logs are formatted correctly according to regulatory standards and that reports are generated as expected.

#### **6. Documentation**

- **`audit-logs-overview.md`**: Provides an overview of the Audit Logs Module, its purpose, and how it integrates with the rest of the application.
- **`user-action-logs-guide.md`**: A detailed guide on setting up and managing user action logs.
- **`critical-event-monitoring-guide.md`**: Instructions for configuring and using the critical event monitoring services.
- **`compliance-reporting-guide.md`**: Steps for generating compliance reports and ensuring that the logs meet regulatory standards.

#### **7. Deployment and Scaling**

- **Scalability**: Ensure that the logging and monitoring services can scale with the application, especially in environments with high user activity or where compliance requirements are strict.
- **Integration with CI/CD**: Include tests for the Audit Logs Module in the CI/CD pipeline to ensure that logging and monitoring are always functioning correctly and that new features do not introduce regressions.
