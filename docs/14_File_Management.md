### **2.5 File Management Module Breakdown**

The File Management Module is essential for handling file uploads, managing media files, and ensuring efficient storage and retrieval across the application. This module supports user-generated content, allowing users to upload files such as images, documents, and videos, which are then managed and served by the application.

#### **1. Responsibilities**

- **File Upload Services**: Handle the secure upload of files, including validation and processing.
- **Media Management**: Organize, store, and retrieve media files efficiently.
- **File Serving**: Provide services for serving files to users, ensuring that files are delivered efficiently and securely.
- **File Metadata Management**: Manage metadata associated with files, such as file type, size, and upload date.

#### **2. Sub-Modules**

1. **Upload Services**:
   - **File Upload Service**: Handles the actual upload of files, including validation of file types and sizes.
   - **File Processing Service**: Processes files after upload, such as image resizing or format conversion.
   - **Upload API**: API endpoints for handling file uploads from the frontend or other services.

2. **Media Management**:
   - **Media Organization Service**: Manages the organization of files into directories or categories.
   - **Media Retrieval Service**: Handles the retrieval of media files based on various criteria (e.g., file type, user).
   - **Media Management API**: API endpoints for managing and retrieving media files.

3. **File Serving**:
   - **File Serving Service**: Serves files to users, ensuring that access is secure and that files are delivered efficiently.
   - **CDN Integration**: Optional integration with a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for faster file delivery.

4. **File Metadata Management**:
   - **Metadata Storage Service**: Stores and manages metadata associated with files.
   - **Metadata Retrieval Service**: Provides functionality to retrieve and update file metadata.
   - **Metadata API**: API endpoints for accessing and managing file metadata.

#### **4. Key Components and Their Descriptions**

- **`FileUploadService.js`**: Manages the secure upload of files, including validating file types and sizes, and ensuring that files are correctly stored.
- **`FileProcessingService.js`**: Handles processing tasks like image resizing or format conversion after files are uploaded, ensuring that files meet application requirements.
- **`MediaOrganizationService.js`**: Manages the organization of files into directories or categories, making it easier to manage and retrieve files later.
- **`FileServingService.js`**: Serves files to users, ensuring that they are delivered securely and efficiently, with the possibility of integrating with a CDN for faster delivery.
- **`MetadataStorageService.js`**: Stores and manages metadata associated with files, such as file type, size, and upload date, allowing for efficient search and retrieval.

#### **5. Testing and Validation**

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual services, such as file uploads and metadata management, to ensure they function correctly.
- **Integration Tests**: Validate that the APIs interact correctly with the underlying services, ensuring that files are uploaded, processed, and served as expected.
- **Validation Tests**: Ensure that all uploaded files meet the application's validation criteria before they are processed and stored.

#### **6. Documentation**
