#### **4. Key Components and Their Descriptions**

- **`ThemeSelector.js`**: The UI component that allows users to select a theme from the available options. It could be integrated into the application’s settings menu or displayed as a dropdown in the UI.

- **`ThemeApplicationService.js`**: A service responsible for applying the selected theme throughout the application. It dynamically changes the styles based on the selected theme configuration.

- **`CustomThemeBuilder.js`**: A user-friendly tool for building custom themes, allowing users to choose colors, fonts, and other design elements.

- **`ThemeStorageService.js`**: Manages the saving and retrieval of custom themes, either by storing them locally on the user's device or saving them to the user’s profile on the backend.

- **`HighContrastTheme.js`**: A theme configuration focused on high contrast, providing better readability for users with visual impairments.

#### **5. Testing and Validation**

- **Unit Tests**: Ensure that individual components, such as the theme selector and custom theme builder, function correctly.
- **Integration Tests**: Validate that the theme switching and custom theme application work seamlessly across the application.
- **Accessibility Testing**: Special tests to ensure that accessibility themes, such as the high-contrast option, meet the required accessibility standards.

#### **6. Documentation**

- **`frontend-themes-overview.md`**: Provides an overview of the Frontend Themes Module, explaining its purpose and how it integrates with the rest of the application.
- **`theme-switching-guide.md`**: A guide detailing how to implement and manage theme switching in the application.

- **`theme-persistence-guide.md`**: A guide explaining how to persist the selected theme across sessions and devices.
- **`accessibility-themes-guide.md`**: Provides best practices and implementation details for creating accessibility-focused themes, such as high-contrast options.

#### **7. Deployment and Scaling**

- **Scalability**: The Frontend Themes Module should be designed to handle a growing number of themes and customizations as the user base expands. It should also ensure that the performance of theme switching remains smooth, even with many themes available.
- **Integration with CI/CD**: Ensure that the Frontend Themes Module is included in the CI/CD pipeline, with automated tests validating the functionality of theme switching, custom themes, and persistence across sessions.
