### **Execution Plan**

1. **Document and Plan**: Begin by creating detailed documentation and planning for each module. Break down the responsibilities, sub-modules, and dependencies.

2. **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**: Start with the Must-Have Modules to build a functional MVP. Focus on User Management, API Gateway, Access Control, Core Utilities, Frontend Core, Testing Module, and DevOps & CI/CD.

3. **Enhance and Optimize**: Once the MVP is stable, move on to the Should-Have Modules to enhance user experience and optimize the development process.

4. **Future-Proof and Expand**: Gradually introduce the Could-Have Modules as the application scales. Assess the impact of each module on the overall architecture and make necessary adjustments to accommodate future growth.

5. **Continuous Integration and Testing**: Ensure that every new module or feature is integrated seamlessly into the existing system. Maintain a robust CI/CD pipeline with extensive testing to prevent regressions and ensure stability.

### **Final Considerations**

As the application grows and evolves, the structure will need continuous evaluation and refinement. Keep scalability, security, and maintainability at the forefront of every decision to ensure the application can handle future demands without significant overhauls.
