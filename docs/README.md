### 00_APPLICATION_MASTER_PLAN.md

I still have all the critical information from the four messages in memory, and I'm ready to implement the feedback and provide you with the refined next-level version of the application master plan, along with the updated versions of the minimum viable application structure and the backend core services structure.

### **Refined Next-Level Application Master Plan**

#### **1. Project Structure and Modularity**

**Enhancements**:
- **Service Discovery & Event-Driven Architecture**: To manage inter-module communication and dependencies more effectively, I recommend introducing a service discovery mechanism (e.g., Consul or Eureka) combined with an event-driven architecture using message queues like RabbitMQ or Kafka. This approach will allow modules to communicate asynchronously, reducing direct dependencies and promoting better scalability.

- **Versioning Strategy**: Implement a robust versioning strategy for both APIs and modules. This will ensure that as new versions of modules are introduced, older versions can still operate without breaking existing functionality. Semantic versioning (e.g., v1, v2) should be used consistently across all APIs.

**Updated Structure**:

│   ├── db-config.json
│   └── versioning-config.json  # API and module versioning configurations
└── docs/
```

#### **2. RBAC and Security**

**Enhancements**:
- **Policy Validation Tool**: Introduce a policy validation tool that allows admins to simulate policy changes in a safe environment before applying them to the live system. This tool could also include a policy simulation API, enabling automated testing of potential policy impacts.

- **Zero-Trust Architecture**: Begin transitioning towards a zero-trust architecture where every request is authenticated and authorized regardless of its origin within the network. This involves enforcing strict identity and access management (IAM) policies, encrypting all data in transit and at rest, and continuously monitoring for unauthorized access.

**Updated RBAC System**:

│   ├── auth.service.js
│   ├── auth.middleware.js
│   ├── strategies/

│   │   └── tests/
│   │       └── policy-validation.test.js
│   ├── tests/
│   │   └── access-control.test.js
```

#### **3. CI/CD and DevOps**

**Enhancements**:
- **Coverage Monitoring and IaC**: Implement a coverage monitoring tool (e.g., Coveralls) to ensure that test coverage remains high across the application. Additionally, integrate Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices using Terraform or AWS CloudFormation to automate the setup and management of the infrastructure.

**Updated CI/CD Pipeline**:

├── tests/
│   ├── integration/
│   ├── unit/
│   ├── e2e/
│   └── coverage/                    # Test coverage reports and monitoring
```

#### **4. Documentation and Onboarding**

**Enhancements**:
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Integrate tools like Notion or Confluence for real-time collaboration on documentation, allowing for more dynamic and interactive updates and feedback cycles.

- **Non-Developer Onboarding Tracks**: Create specialized onboarding tracks for non-developers (e.g., product managers, designers) that focus on understanding the system's architecture without needing deep technical knowledge.

**Updated Documentation Strategy**:

├── collaboration/                 # Real-time collaboration documents
│   └── notion-integration.md      # Guide on using Notion for collaboration
```

#### **5. Future Development and Adaptability**

**Enhancements**:
- **Technical Debt Management**: Implement a technical debt register and schedule regular refactoring sessions to manage and reduce technical debt as the project grows.

- **Data Architecture for AI/ML**: As AI and machine learning become more integrated into the application, start planning for specialized data storage solutions (e.g., data lakes) and ML model management tools (e.g., MLflow).

**Updated Future-Ready Architecture**:
